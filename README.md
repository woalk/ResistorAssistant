# Resistor Assistant

### Summary

A calculator app for **Android** for resistor resistance values in Ohm, including additional information like tolerance and temperature coefficient, if applicable.

Just requires selecting the color bands of any resistor.

It can also work backwards:
You can input any Ohm value und the app will tell you how this value can be represented as color bands.
Up to two different suggestions are made, if applicable.

#### The Resistor Assistant feature

The Resistor Assistant is an experimental feature of this app.
You can talk to Resistor Assistant and ask for an Ohm value or a color code, and it will answer you with the respective conversion.

You can either use text-based exchange, or use your device's microphone for voice recognition by the press of a button.
